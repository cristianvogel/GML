### Generative Movement Language
by Cristian Vogel

A token based score generator which uses context-free grammars
and (optional) word lists to generate scores. By working with tokens
as the mode of generating output, a score can be interpreted and assigned meaning
by human performers and/or virtual agents during realtime performance

GML system and codebase was conceived and maintained by Cristian Vogel
with essential contributions from Daniel Howe of RiTa lib and MDK of Korisna Media
<br>

##### Note: RiTa grammars must now be in proper JSON or YAML format
