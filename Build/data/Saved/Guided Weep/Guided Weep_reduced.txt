city silent table legs 
made feather centre two 
holy grails filled quicksilver 
ground close Nathalie Sofia 
squeezing tuff love entwine 
guest guided closely towards 
guide rest beneath perimeter 
move glued together lightly 
remove gloves glasses begin 
bathe feet water soft 
cloths gently wipe hand 
liquid gold leaves burning 
distant song begins twirl 
helped carefully lie top 
stand almost touching smoothly 
massage oil shoulder hold 
back calves forehead hips 
channel symbol black spiral 
minutes pass becomes rhythmic 
softly place spirals onto 
upper chest finishes feathers 
placed caressing hug Music 
starts dance loving Bolero 
finishing completely lay cave
