Leaves Eyeball 


The cave is dark with candles lit.
There is a dirt table in the centre of the cave.
two eye-balls filled with liquid gold are on the ground close to the table.
Nathalie and Sofia are holding each other in a tuff love hug.
The guest is guided lightly towards the table.
Nathalie and Sofia guide the guest to grasp into the side of the table

Nathalie and Sofia move as if they are locked together
They slowly remove the shoes and glasses from the guest
They begin to bathe the feet with water and soft cloths
Then they gently wipe each hand of the guest with liquid gold and smooth leaves
The burning sound texture begins to turn
The guest is then helped carefully to lie down on top of the table
Sofia and Nathalie stand almost touching each other
and lovingly massage oil into each ankle of the guest
They move around the table to hold the belly and the fingers
As they hold the spine and the shoulders, they channel the symbol of a black triangle
For three minutes they pass the triangle as the sound texture becomes more intense
they softly place leaves and silicon chips onto the front of the body  , knees and chest of the guest
The sound texture finishes. The silicon chips have been placed.
Nathalie and Sofia are holding each other in a soothing hold.
Music starts and they begin to dance a comforting Prophetic dance around the table.
The sound texture is disappearing completely and they sit with each other.
The city starts to revolve.
