Guided Weep 


The city is silent.
There is a table with legs made of feather in the centre of the city.
two holy grails filled with quicksilver are on the ground close to the table with legs made of feather.
Nathalie and Sofia are squeezing each other in a tuff love entwine.
The guest is guided closely towards the table with legs made of feather.
Nathalie and Sofia guide the guest to rest beneath the perimeter of the table with legs made of feather

Nathalie and Sofia move as if they are glued together
They lightly remove the gloves and glasses from the guest
They begin to bathe the feet with water and soft cloths
Then they gently wipe each hand of the guest with liquid gold and soft leaves
The burning distant song begins to twirl
The guest is then helped carefully to lie down on top of the table with legs made of feather
Sofia and Nathalie stand almost touching each other
and smoothly massage oil into each shoulder of the guest
They move around the table with legs made of feather to hold the back and the calves
As they hold the forehead and the hips, they channel the symbol of a black spiral
For two minutes they pass the spiral as the distant song becomes more rhythmic
they softly place leaves and spirals onto the upper back  , feet and chest of the guest
The distant song finishes. The feathers have been placed.
Nathalie and Sofia are squeezing each other in a caressing hug.
Music starts and they begin to dance a loving Bolero around the table with legs made of feather.
The distant song is finishing completely and they lay with each other.
The cave starts to turn.
